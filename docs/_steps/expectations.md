**When to use:** tripwires for data quality. Anything that should always be true about your data — uniqueness, ranges, allowed values, regex patterns — encode as an expectation. The step never modifies the data; it only reports violations and (optionally) fails the run.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "step": "expectations",
  "params": {
    "rules": [
      {"kind": "unique", "column": "customer_id"},
      {"kind": "not_null", "column": "email"},
      {"kind": "between", "column": "age", "min": 0, "max": 120},
      {"kind": "in", "column": "status", "values": ["active", "churned", "trial"]},
      {"kind": "regex_match", "column": "email", "pattern": "^[^@]+@[^@]+\\.[^@]+$"},
      {"kind": "row_count_between", "min": 1000}
    ],
    "fail_on_violation": false
  }
}
```

Each rule produces a result entry; the artifacts panel summarizes "5/6 rules passed" and lists each failure inline.

**Tip:** put `expectations` immediately *before* a sink (export) step. That way you fail fast and the bad data never lands in your downstream warehouse.
